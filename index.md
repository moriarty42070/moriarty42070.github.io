## Overview

The `ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct` library enables efficient reduction operations on ndarrays. It performs a reduction over specified dimensions using a one-dimensional strided array reduction function. The results are assigned to a provided output ndarray. This approach optimizes memory usage and computational efficiency.

## Features

- **Flexible Reduction**: Choose which dimensions to reduce.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses strided arrays to minimize memory overhead.
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrates with existing JavaScript applications.
- **Robust Performance**: Designed for high-performance applications requiring fast array computations.

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct
```

Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org).

## Usage

To use the library, first require it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct');
```

You can then perform reductions on your ndarrays. Below is a simple example:

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const data = ndarray(new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4]), [2, 2]);
const output = ndarray(new Float32Array(2), [2]);

reduce(data, output, 0, (a, b) => a + b);
console.log(output); // Output will show the reduced values
```

## API Reference

### `reduce(input, output, dimension, reducer)`

- **input**: The input ndarray to reduce.
- **output**: The output ndarray where results will be stored.
- **dimension**: The dimension(s) to reduce.
- **reducer**: A function that defines how to reduce values.

### Example Reducer Function

A simple reducer function could be defined as follows:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

You can pass this function to the `reduce` method to perform addition over the specified dimension.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sum of Elements

Hereâ€™s an example of summing elements along the first dimension:

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct');

const data = ndarray(new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), [2, 3]);
const output = ndarray(new Float32Array(2), [2]);

reduce(data, output, 1, (a, b) => a + b);
console.log(output); // Outputs the sum of each row
```

### Example 2: Custom Reduction

You can also create custom reduction functions. Hereâ€™s an example that finds the maximum value:

```javascript
function max(a, b) {
    return a > b ? a : b;
}

const outputMax = ndarray(new Float32Array(2), [2]);
reduce(data, outputMax, 1, max);
console.log(outputMax); // Outputs the maximum of each row
```
